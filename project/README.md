# Squid game: red light, green light

## How to play

Buttons S1 and S2 are P1 movement buttons. S3 and S4 are P2 movement
buttons. Press each button once to move. Each time a button is pressed the
next correct move button is flipped. For example, if the current correct
button for P1 is S1, when P1 presses a button, the next correct movement
button will now be S2. If the player presses the incorrect button it will move
backwards, forward otherwise.

### Green light:

When the light is green, the players can press buttons to move forward, or
backwards if incorrect.

### Red light:

Players can not move on a red light. If a player presses a button, this player
will be shot and sent back to initial position.
